My name is Phimonrat Panaphong and my nickname is Belle,
s3885709, s3885709@student.rmit.edu.au. I am originally from Bangkok, Thailand and live
in Sydney, Australia. I am 37-year-old, and I am Buddhism. I graduated Bachelor's degree in
international business management from Thailand and had completed Diploma of Business
Management in Sydney. I speak Thai, English and Spanish (fairly). I enjoy cooking, baking,
listening to music, watching Korean drama, and re-arranging and organising wardrobe. I
am Sagittarius and I am fair-minded, optimistic, hilarious, spontaneous, and honest.

I'm married with Ecuadorian-Australian father role-model. We have two gorgeous girls. 
They are 3 and 5 year old. My current goal is finishing Bachelor of IT and building 
my IT career and try my best to be the best mom, student and wife. :grin: 


# Interest in IT

* What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
Outline your ITexperience

During the lock down, my husband got an identification stolen. He could not access to his
emails and could not use his phone. We found out later that someone in Tasmania
requested for his phone SIM card replacement. That moment I thought if I have a good
knowledge about IT or at least know how the hacker penetrates. My husband would not
experience the challenging time and terrified that someone will steal our finance or commit
a fraud under his identity.


* Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

According to the story above, I started to look for a good options and flexible courses. I
found RMIT through Open University and when I found out that RMIT offer a 100%
online bachelor's degree in IT. I cannot let go of this opportunity and here I am :smile: 


* What do you expect to learn during your studies?

As you know that I am a new learner in IT and I do have little knowledge about technology. I
am expecting to learn more about creating website and comprehensive the functionality of
hardware and software including cloud storage. Learning more about coding and
programming would be a great benefit to the future career as well.
