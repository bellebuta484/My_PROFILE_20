# Interest in IT

* What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
Outline your ITexperience

During the lock down, my husband got an identification stolen. He could not access to his
emails and could not use his phone. We found out later that someone in Tasmania
requested for his phone SIM card replacement. That moment I thought if I have a good
knowledge about IT or at least know how the hacker penetrates. My husband would not
experience the challenging time and terrified that someone will steal our finance or commit
a fraud under his identity.


* Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

According to the story above, I started to look for a good options and flexible courses. I
found RMIT through Open University and when I found out that RMIT offer a 100%
online bachelor's degree in IT. I cannot let go of this opportunity and here I am :smile: 


* What do you expect to learn during your studies?

As you know that I am a new learner in IT and I do have little knowledge about technology. I
am expecting to learn more about creating website and comprehensive the functionality of
hardware and software including cloud storage. Learning more about coding and
programming would be a great benefit to the future career as well.

# Project Idea

![](images/1*LLaLA4kIA6bkd8Ob0rYxxQ.jpeg)



## Overview

An eyewear is essential item for those who has visual problems but if we could make
eyewear for medical use. What will it be for? Will it be for x-ray and detect the small lung
cancer? Or will it be a weaponize glasses that work like 007.
I’d like to introduce the body temperature detecting glasses to be called CV2020. These
glasses made to detect the human body temperature from 36.5c to 42.0c. This is hoping to
help minimise the risk of contracting novel virus called SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 and increase
the awareness in our community.

This eyewear is made of 100% natural pinewood, recycle material and environment friendly.
It comes in variety of styles and colors.


## Motivation

In early of 2020, the novel virus called Covid 19 was introduced to us by a surprise. The
pandemic started late 2019 and keep continuing until now. The virus has spread around the
world, killing at least 1.6 million people, including more than 300,000 in the United
State and around 1,000 in Australia.

The virus transmission is through the close contact including hug, kiss, touch and
respiratory. The main symptoms are fever, short of breath, sore throat, and coughing with
an incubation period of 4 – 7 days, with a range of 1 – 14 days. Most people who are
infected will develop symptoms within 14 days of infection.

All the scientists are looking for a vaccination to cure this virus but it’s undergoing and in a
trial period. This time being we need to look after ourselves by keeping our
hands hygiene and eating healthy. Moreover, wearing the genius CV2020 will
help notifying when you are in a close contact with someone who has fever of 37.4c or
more. This will minimise the risk of contracting virus.

## Description

Body temperature detecting wooden glasses is to be called CV2020, modified from the
traditional hand-held thermometer but with a developed 5 meters measuring distance. It is
an advance technology that developed for preventing the virus cross infection. The device is
using uncooled infrared thermal sensor between 36.5c to 42.0c

CV2020 is safe and efficient, because of its unique way of detecting temperature without
physical touch. It is lightweight and comfortable to wear and comes in variety and color. The
temperature can be detected very fast in 10 milliseconds.

The glasses lenses are designed for prolong wearing with a switch to reduce the
discomfort from your eyes. You can switch the lenses by touching the lenses with your clean
finger. It works like touchscreen mobile phone. You can even choose between prescription
glasses or sunglasses.

The battery operate is chargeable through type C USB cable connect; DC 5V, 2A; Recharge in
1 hour and can be use up to 5 hours once fully charged. Solar charger is sold separately.
With a genius sensor the glasses turn on and activated as soon as you put it on.
This thermometer detector can be connected to your smart phone or smart watch to track
how many people with fever in that area you are in. To minimise the risk of contracting the
virus. Moreover, these are including some unique features, such
as, weather forecast, and reminder, and messages once connect to smart phone or smart-watch.

The three layers lenses that provide a shade protection from sunray UV when needed and
genius bottom command switch on and off on the glasses left temple.
This product come with 2 years warranty and free cleaning after 1 year of use.

## Tools and Technologies

CV2020 runs with chargeable battery and operate with PC software analysis.
Using the infrared technology with a resolution of 16x120 and lenses resolution is
400x250 with power consumption less than 500mW5

Using 5.2 Bluetooth compatibility. The glass frame is made of pine wood which water and
dust resistant and environmentally friendly. CV2020 is using an infrared thermometer or a
none contact laser thermometer that provide an accurate information.

## Skills Required

• Glasses terminology knowledge
• Pine wood and how to assemble
• Graphic design
• PC software analysis
• Bluetooth installation
• Infared installation

The skills, hardware, and software above are possible to find and can adapt from the
general glasses. The pine wood and how to assemble can obtain it from a go
green glasses' factory in Southeast Asia. As CV2020 is modified from hand-held
thermomotor, the feasible of how to find a software and skills to make this CV2020 is
highly possible.


## Outcome

If the project is successful, the virus spread will decrease, and less people will be
contracting and hopefully everything will come back to normal. This project will save life and
possibility to meliorate the product to be more advance, such as, use for detecting
the cancer, HIV, heart failure and so on.
The con this project might have is, people, some human being might use it for a bad
intension and for a criminal purpose, such as, use the glasses to detect of someone in the
car to steal the car, steal glasses and check the store data that link to smart phone or smart
watch etc.
