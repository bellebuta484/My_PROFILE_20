# Interest in IT

* What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
Outline your ITexperience

During the lock down, my husband got an identification stolen. He could not access to his
emails and could not use his phone. We found out later that someone in Tasmania
requested for his phone SIM card replacement. That moment I thought if I have a good
knowledge about IT or at least know how the hacker penetrates. My husband would not
experience the challenging time and terrified that someone will steal our finance or commit
a fraud under his identity.


* Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

According to the story above, I started to look for a good options and flexible courses. I
found RMIT through Open University and when I found out that RMIT offer a 100%
online bachelor's degree in IT. I cannot let go of this opportunity and here I am :smile: 


* What do you expect to learn during your studies?

As you know that I am a new learner in IT and I do have little knowledge about technology. I
am expecting to learn more about creating website and comprehensive the functionality of
hardware and software including cloud storage. Learning more about coding and
programming would be a great benefit to the future career as well.

# Project Idea





## Overview

An eyewear is essential item for those who has visual problems but if we could make
eyewear for medical use. What will it be for? Will it be for x-ray and detect the small lung
cancer? Or will it be a weaponize glasses that work like 007.
I’d like to introduce the body temperature detecting glasses to be called CV2020. These
glasses made to detect the human body temperature from 36.5c to 42.0c. This is hoping to
help minimise the risk of contracting novel virus called SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 and increase
the awareness in our community.

This eyewear is made of 100% natural pinewood, recycle material and environment friendly.
It comes in variety of styles and colors.

## Motivation

In early of 2020, the novel virus called Covid 19 was introduced to us by a surprise. The
pandemic started late 2019 and keep continuing until now. The virus has spread around the
world, killing at least 1.6 million people, including more than 300,000 in the United
State and around 1,000 in Australia.

The virus transmission is through the close contact including hug, kiss, touch and
respiratory. The main symptoms are fever, short of breath, sore throat, and coughing with
an incubation period of 4 – 7 days, with a range of 1 – 14 days. Most people who are
infected will develop symptoms within 14 days of infection.

All the scientists are looking for a vaccination to cure this virus but it’s undergoing and in a
trial period. This time being we need to look after ourselves by keeping our
hands hygiene and eating healthy. Moreover, wearing the genius CV2020 will
help notifying when you are in a close contact with someone who has fever of 37.4c or
more. This will minimise the risk of contracting virus.
